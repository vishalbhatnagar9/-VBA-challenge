Module 2 Challenge

Note: Despite all effcorts to run the code on "Multi_year Stock Data" sheet, computer was not able to process such large data. I have attempted to run this code on my personal lap top (that I use for the Bootcamp) 
as well as two work laptops (thinking they may have more processing power)
  However, I was unable to have the results fully generated of the code before Excel kept crashing. 
I have the code uploaded and link shared. However, I wanted to provide analysis of the code so I have used the smaller set (Alphabetical Testing Challenge sheet) to show this. Although, I understand, this was not the ask.
