Module 2 Challenge

Note: Despite all efforts to run the code on "Multi_year Stock Data" sheet, my computer was not able to process such large data. I have attempted to run this code on my personal laptop (that I use for the Bootcamp) 
as well as two work laptops (thinking they may have more processing power).
  - However, I was unable to have the results fully generated of the code before Excel kept crashing. 
I have the code uploaded and link shared. However, I wanted to provide analysis of the code so I have used the smaller set (Alphabetical Testing Challenge sheet) to show this. Although, I understand, this was not the ask but also I wanted to present what I would have done if my Excel cooperated with the larger set. 

Analysis:

    For Stocks starting with Alphabet "A", 
  Greatest % Increase stock is AAR,
  Greatest % Decrease Stock is AYO,
  Greatest Total Volume is carried by the Stock AUE

  Positive Stocks - 44%,
  Negative Stocks - 54%,
  Zero Value Stock - 1%

    For Stocks starting with Alphabet "B", 
  Greatest % Increase stock is BLC,
  Greatest % Decrease Stock is BAJQ,
  Greatest Total Volume is carried by the Stock BQK

  Positive Stocks - 44%,
  Negative Stocks - 42%
  
    For Stocks starting with Alphabet "C", 
  Greatest % Increase stock is CCN,
  Greatest % Decrease Stock is CKN,
  Greatest Total Volume is carried by the Stock CPWA

  Positive Stocks - 42%,
  Negative Stocks - 57%,
  Zero Value Stock - 1%

    For Stocks starting with Alphabet "D", 
  Greatest % Increase stock is DLUW,
  Greatest % Decrease Stock is DRU,
  Greatest Total Volume is carried by the Stock DNR

  Positive Stocks - 42%,
  Negative Stocks - 54%,
  Zero Value Stock - 4%

    For Stocks starting with Alphabet "E", 
  Greatest % Increase stock is EPX,
  Greatest % Decrease Stock is EEA,
  Greatest Total Volume is carried by the Stock EPP

  Positive Stocks - 45%,
  Negative Stocks - 55%

    For Stocks starting with Alphabet "F", 
  Greatest % Increase stock is FGH,
  Greatest % Decrease Stock is FGA,
  Greatest Total Volume is carried by the Stock FNC

  Positive Stocks - 48%,
  Negative Stocks - 50%,
  Zero Value Stock - 2%

    For the Multi-Year Stock data set, it would be then determined, which year has the most positive, negative, and zero stocks as well as understanding the stocks with greatest increase and decrease. 

  Reference/Citing - I leveraged ASKBCS as a thought partner for some areas of the code that I was confused on.
